			is very straightforward to operate.</p>
		<h2>Usage Scenarios Beyond Example Tutorials:</h2>
		<p>Scenario One: I need to divide a 2-year period, from January
			2020 to December 2022, into 4 equal time segments. How to do it?</p>
		<p>Solution: You can input "2020-01 6", and it will calculate the
			date 6 months after January 2020. Repeat this process to get the time
			segments.</p>
