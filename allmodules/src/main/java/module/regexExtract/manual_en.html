		<h3>Task to resolve</h3>
		<p>Given a text file, each line has a fixed format string. The
			target information is extracted from each line of string.</p>

		<h3>Quick start</h3>
		<p>Any actions are straightforward. Please follow the GUI
			instructions.</p>

		<h4>Application Example</h4>

		<p>By running the example file of this module, we have the
			following content:</p>

		<pre>Saccharomyces cerevisiae - Baker's yeast (酿酒酵母)
Caenorhabditis elegans - Nematode (秀丽隐杆线虫)
Drosophila melanogaster - Fruit fly (黑腹果蝇)
</pre>
		<p>我们的想得到的结果是生成一个以Tab键分隔的文本内容如下：</p>
		<pre>Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Baker's yeast	酿酒酵母
Caenorhabditis elegans	Nematode	秀丽隐杆线虫
Drosophila melanogaster	Fruit fly	黑腹果蝇
</pre>

		<p>To achieve this requirement, regular expressions would be
			needed if we wrote the script ourselves. This would involve using an
			IDE to write the script or directly in a terminal window, and the
			completed script is typically used only once. Such operations require
			a shift in thinking for researchers and are not very convenient to
			use.</p>
		<p>Therefore, this module was developed, and using it only
			requires three steps.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Generate a regular expression based on the string extraction
				requirements from the web-based AI model. For example, the regular
				expression to achieve this functionality is
				(.*?)\\s*-\\s*(.*?)\\s*\\((.*?)\\)</li>
			<li>Enter the remaining necessary parameters, such as the input
				and output file paths</li>
			<li>The third step is to run it, either through the command line
				or by clicking the run button on the graphical interface</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Tip: The input and output file paths can be expanded or you can
			directly paste the string address. You can create bookmarks using the
			VOICM's history function for reuse in future similar requirements.</p>


		<h3>Command Line Usage</h3>
		<p>Assuming that "$libPath" is the directory where the JAVA
			library files are located, the following command can be used:</p>
		<p>java -cp "$libPath"
            edu.sinh.beauty.unisoft.module.treenodecoll.CLI configFile</p>
		<p>Since VOICM has the ability to run script records, the command
			line is actually more cumbersome to use.</p>
