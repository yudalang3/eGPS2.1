		<h3>Task to resolve</h3>
		<p>The Ensembl official website provides download links for genomic data and genome annotations at FTP Download (https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html?redirect=no
). However, in many cases, we need to download data in bulk. The entire process includes understanding the organization of the website's data and obtaining links for bulk downloads.
We use an operations platform class to handle this issue.</p>
		<h3>Quick start</h3>
		<p>All user actions are straightforward. Please follow the GUI instructions.</p>


		<ol>
      <li>Click the import button to open the data import dialog.</li>
			<li>View the required input data in the parameter input area. When the module provides more than one example, you can click the example button to see the next.</li>
      <li>The user enters the required parameters.</li>
			<li>Click the Execute button to see the results.</li>
		</ol>
