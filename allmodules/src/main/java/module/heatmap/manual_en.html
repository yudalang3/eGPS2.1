		<h3>Task to resolve</h3>
		<p>Text present the back mutations.</p>

		<h3>Quick start</h3>
		<p>Any actions are straightforward. Please follow the GUI
			instructions.</p>


		<ol>
			<li>Click the Example button to see the input data.</li>
			<li>Click the Execute button to see the results.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Features of the heatmap:</h3>
		<p>This module has the following features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To be able to transform data, including: 1) transposition;
				2) various normalized transformations</li>
			<li>Support visualization of large matrices</li>
			<li>Support for adding labels to rows or columns</li>
			<li>Support hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering.</li>
			<li>Users can import phylogenetic trees and coexist with heat
				maps</li>
			<li>Support add block and gap conveniently</li>
			<li>Highly interactive, drag and drop graphic elements</li>
			<li>A good color configurator to set the color scheme</li>
			<li>It can also be scripted and run like a command line.</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>The basics of heatmap:</h3>

		<p>For a data matrix M = {x_ij}, let min be the minimum of the
			matrix M and max be the maximum of M. Then define a gradient color
			bar, for example from white to red. Then the color corresponding to
			min is white, max corresponds to red, and the other values x_ij
			display corresponding colors according to linear correspondence. This
			is the heatmap, in principle, nothing more! So, for a heat map, some
			operations are absolutely meaningless: for example</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Drag a piece out of the heatmap.</li>
			<li>We change the color of a piece of cell in the heatmap.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Users can customize the color bar of the heatmap, but a very
			fine-grained correspondence of color relationships has not yet been
			implemented. For example, assuming the data to be visualized has a
			minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 11, users need to customize
			the range [0,1) to be white, the range [1,2) to be red, and the range
			[2, +infinity) to be dark red.</p>

		<p>The default interface display parameters of the heat map are:
			the border of each cell, the row name, the column name and the
			legend.</p>

		<h3>Description of the parameter bar on the left</h3>

		<h4>Convenient Operation</h4>
		从上到下依此为：
		<ol>
			<li>The first one is adaptive button. When you change the window
				size, you can press this button to automatically adapt to the
				window.</li>
			<li>The second is to re-set all parameters to the default state.</li>
			<li>The third is the transpose of the input matrix.</li>
			<li>Store the current parameters and data, similar to the save
				when playing games</li>
			<li>Restore, you can directly restore after saving data.</li>
			<li>Import the evolution tree file, and arrange the evolution
				tree on the left side. Note that the OUT tree's OUT name and number
				are consistent with all row names.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Cell Properties</h4>
		<p>The Cell Properties column has been added to adjust the color
			and shape of each cell. All operations are very intuitive, and users
			can explore on their own. The most important aspect of the heatmap,
			the color scheme, can be set here. We have pre-set some color
			schemes, and we also support users in customizing their own.
			Selecting the costumed option allows for individual color
			configuration, and detailed usage can be found in the following text.</p>
		<h4>Data Transformation</h4>

		Data Transformation: There are a variety of data transformation for
		each row, if you need to transform the line, please transpose first.

		<ol>
			<li>Z-score is a standard normalization transform</li>
			<li>Min-Max scaling with (x_ij –min) / (max - min) formula</li>
			<li>Min-Max scaling是(x_ij –min) / (max - min) 变换；</li>
			<li>conventional log transforms</li>
			<li>Cox-Box transforms. The strategy we now implement for the
				last transformation is : When the row data is all greater than 0,
				the lambda takes the values {-2, -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2}
				in turn, and then uses the Kolmogorov Smirnov Test to test the
				normality of the data. Take the most normal lambda value and finally
				give the average.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Hierarchical Clustering</h4>

		There are three main types of parameters here. The first one is
		hierarchical clustering. The change of component values in Element
		triggers the clustering operation. Users can choose to cluster rows,
		columns, or both. Hierarchical clustering has two important
		parameters, including the calculation method of the distance matrix
		and the Linkage method. The Keep original order option indicates
		whether the tree of the cluster is to be ladderized. If the original
		order is maintained, then this step is not performed.
		<h4>K-Means++ Clustering</h4>
		K-means clustering, after setting the parameters : Number of clusters,
		Maximum iterations and the distance between each vector. Similarly,
		clustering can be triggered by changes to component values in Element.
		The results of K-means will be displayed like row annotations.

		<h4>Display Options</h4>
		Display is an option for visual effects: The first is Data values ,
		which indicates whether to display the value of each heatmap grid. A
		change in the component value in Value status triggers a change in the
		heatmap. Number of decimals indicates the number of decimal places
		displayed; Partial bounds factor is set for the Partial Ori. and
		Partial Pre. options. When this option is selected: minValue<= x <=
		minValue + factor and maxValue - factor <= x <= maxValue will be
		displayed. This option is primarily aimed at people who are often
		interested in extreme values.<br> <br> The second is the
		Border option. Clicking on the Check box component will trigger an
		update. The user can click the Col button to change the color.<br>
		<br> The third is the Legend option. Clicking on the Check box
		component will trigger an update. The size of the Legend is drawn
		according to the length and width set.<br> <br> The fourth
		and fifth operations are on row and column names. Clicking on the
		Check box component will trigger an update. These operations are based
		on the angle of rotation, font, and color.<br> <br> The
		sixth is to configure the shape and color of the grid. The most
		important color scheme for the heat map can be set here. We have
		preset some color schemes, and we support users to do their own color
		matching. You can configure the color yourself by selecting the
		costumed option. See below for detailed usage.

		<h4>Heatmap color scheme designer</h4>

		The color scheme designer in the heatmap module can be toggled when
		you click the Cell -> Color scheme -> costumed parameter in the
		display options parameter bar.<br> <br> The top layer is a
		preview of the gradient color, which can be previewed directly after
		configuring the color.<br> <br> This is followed by a color
		allocator that allows the user to add or remove color coordinates, and
		each color coordinate can be re-set. In particular, we implemented a
		full-screen color picker that allows users to pick colors from other
		places.<br> <br> Below is a default color picker that takes
		colors from the sample, HSV, HSL, RGB, CMYK sub-sections.<br> <br>
		The finished color will show a preview here.<br> <br>
		Finally, the corresponding button, Screen color picker can change the
		global color selector, followed by the RGB value of a color. Clicking
		the OK button will apply the current gradient on the heat map.


		<h4>Layout option</h4>

		In the final Layout option bar, we currently implement the rectangular
		layout, because our heat map itself is highly interactive, so here are
		just some of the results of the current assignment. A new circular
		layout is added to circularize the heat map.

		<h3>Interactive operations:</h3>
		The interactive function of the heat map is described below. We will
		take the heat map after importing the first example.<br> When the
		mouse clicks on the node of the cluster tree, you can select the
		corresponding cluster. The following menu will pop up when you right
		click:<br>
		<br> The first one is a new comment, and the CellType and
		GeneClass on the right are comments. The new tree on the left will be
		displayed as a line comment, and the tree above will be added as a
		column comment. The second is to output the cluster information, which
		will be output as a single file in the form of a row name or column
		name. The third and fourth are to remove the comment, the fifth and
		sixth are to remove the gap.<br>
		<br> When the mouse clicks on the comment label in the figure,
		the selected state is displayed, and pressing the "Delete" button
		deletes the single comment.<br>
		<br> When the mouse clicks on the grid, the activation status is
		displayed. Drag and drop the grid to add gaps when the selection state
		is activated.<br>
		<br> You can also set a comment label when you drag and drop a
		batch to select a row or column name. The difference is that it has
		more features that can be loaded into existing tags.
