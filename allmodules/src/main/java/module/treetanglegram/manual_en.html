		<h3>Task to resolve</h3>
		<p>Compare the differences of the two phylogenetic trees.</p>

		<h3>Quick start</h3>
		<p>Any actions are straightforward. Please follow the GUI
			instructions.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Using this module only requires inputting two files in the
				NWK format. On the parameter panel, you can choose to include an
				outgroup. If an outgroup is not included, the program will directly
				read the data for visualization. After entering the name of the
				outgroup, the program will first re-root the tree based on the
				corresponding node of this name, and then rearrange the tree.</li>
			<li>Users can also adjust the 'Name font' to achieve a more
				desirable effect.</li>
			<li>Click the <i>View tanglegram button</i> to display the
				graph.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Command Line Usage</h3>
		<p>The '$libPath' is the directory where the JAVA lib is located.
			The following is the command line to use:</p>
		<p>java -cp "$libPath"
			egps2.module.evoltree.graphics.QuickCompareTwoTreeCLI</p>
