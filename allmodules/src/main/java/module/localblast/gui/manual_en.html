		<h3>Task to resolve</h3>
		<p>A convenient blast software GUI operation module.</p>

		<h3>Quick start</h3>
		<p>Any actions are straightforward. Please follow the GUI
			instructions.</p>
		<p>Note: user need to download the blast software first, and
			provides the bin directory.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Input the necessary parameters on the graphical interface. For the parameters of the path class, the user can quickly complete it by dragging the mouse or copying the path.</li>
			<li>Click the Execute button to see the results.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Caution</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>To avoid any issues, all file paths should be in English.</li>
		<li>You may notice that in BLAST XML files, sometimes BLAST replaces your real sequence IDs with its own generated IDs. For example, the query ID becomes 'QUERY_1', 'QUERY_2', and so on. And hit IDs sometimes become 'GNL|BL_ORD_ID| 1', 'GNL|BL_ORD_ID| 2', and so on. In these cases, BLAST will gather the real sequence IDs and their descriptions together.<br>So do not be alarmed if you see some strange characters.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Important Parameter Q&A</h3>
<p>The output format of BLAST can be controlled by outfmt, with 18 formats available. The commonly used outfmt 6 has a default output of: qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore. Additionally, formats 6, 7, 10, and 17 allow for adjustments in the output content.</p>
<p>The information corresponding to these 12 columns is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Query id: Identifier for the query sequence</li>
  <li>Subject id: Identifier for the aligned target sequence</li>
  <li>% identity: The percentage of sequence alignment identity</li>
  <li>Alignment length: The length of the alignment region that meets the criteria</li>
  <li>Mismatches: The number of mismatches in the alignment region</li>
  <li>Gap openings: The number of gaps in the alignment region</li>
  <li>Q. start: The starting position of the alignment region on the query sequence (Query id)</li>
  <li>Q. end: The ending position of the alignment region on the query sequence (Query id)</li>
  <li>S. start: The starting position of the alignment region on the target sequence (Subject id)</li>
  <li>S. end: The ending position of the alignment region on the target sequence (Subject id)</li>
  <li>E-value: The expected value of the alignment results, which indicates how often you would expect to see a match of equal or higher score if the sequences were shuffled at random. The lower the value, the more conserved the function; a higher E-value suggests that the high score is due to GC content or repetitive sequences. This is a very meaningful parameter for judging homology.</li>
  <li>Bit score: The bit score value of the alignment results</li>
</ol>
<p>
  -outfmt supports the generation of SAM format.
