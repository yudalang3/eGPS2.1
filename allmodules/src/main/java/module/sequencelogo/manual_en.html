		<h3>Task to resolve</h3>
		<p>Draw sequence logo diagrams.</p>

		<h3>Quick start</h3>
		<p>Any actions are straightforward. Please follow the GUI
			instructions.</p>

		<ol>
			<li> It supports various input formats including sequence files, FASTA files, and frequency files. 
			For detailed formatting examples, please refer to the Example section. 
			You can either paste your text directly into the provided text box or import files directly for processing.</li>
			<li>Operations required before generating sequence logo diagrams: 
			Select the sequence type to specify whether the input sequence is DNA, RNA, or protein; 
			select the data type in Import Data Type to determine whether the input data format is 
			a sequence file, FASTA file, or frequency file.</li>
			<li>Optional operations before generating sequence logo diagrams: 
			Select the orientation of the abscissa axis, either horizontal or vertical, 
			with the default being horizontal; choose the type of sequence logo generated, 
			either Bits or Frequency, with Bits being the default; 
			select the size of the generated sequence logo, which will adjust automatically 
			based on the panel size by default.</li>
			<li>Finally, click the "Create sequence logo" button to generate the sequence logo.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>It supports generating sequence logo diagrams from MEME-Chip result files.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You can either directly paste the text into the text box or import a file. 
			However, the format must be a MEME-Chip generated MEME result file.</li>
			<li>Operations required before generating sequence logo diagrams: 
			Select the sequence type to specify whether the input sequence is DNA, RNA, or protein.</li>
			<li>Optional operations before generating sequence logo diagrams: 
			Select the orientation of the abscissa axis, either horizontal or vertical, 
			with the default being horizontal; choose the type of sequence logo generated, 
			either Bits or Frequency, with Bits being the default; select the output file format 
			in Output Format, with the default being jpg format; choose the Output Folder, 
			where the files will be output to the "outImage" directory within that selected folder.</li>
			<li>Finally, click the "Create sequence logo" button to generate the sequence logo. 
			The first five generated sequence logo images will be displayed.</li>
